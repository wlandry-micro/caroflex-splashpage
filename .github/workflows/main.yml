# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This job builds the project and deploys it
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Specifies the operating system for the job

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Use a stable Node.js version compatible with your project

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install # Or 'yarn install' if you use Yarn

      # Step 4: Build the project for production
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build # This command typically creates a 'dist' or 'build' folder

      # Step 5: Deploy the built project to GitHub Pages
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4

          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # GitHub's built-in token
          publish_dir: ./dist # The directory containing your built website files (Lovable.dev likely outputs to 'dist')
          # If your GitHub Pages is for a project site (e.g., yourusername.github.io/repo-name),
          # you might need to add a base URL in your project's build config (e.g., vite.config.ts)
          # and ensure the 'CNAME' file is handled. The peaceiris action handles CNAME by default.
